# The Mentalist

The Mentalist is a guessing game that the web app will choose a random number between 1 and 1000 and you have to guess what number is. The app will tell you if your guess is greater or lesser than his number. You'll have 10 chances to hit the correct number. Every new game, a new number is generated.

You can try the game <a href="https://bryandev-aluramentalista.netlify.app/">here</a>

Have Fun!

# Things that you should know

## <app-button>
The <app-button> have one dynamic property called "text". That's the only way you can change the name in the button.
The tag will be <app-button text="your text here"> </app-button> and the button will replace the standard name (standard name: "Palpitar").

## <app-input>
The <app-input> tag have three dynamic properties: Two of them are Inputs, and the other one is Output. You can set if your Input is readonly by setting isReadonly (false is default) to true on tag. You can change the placeholder setting placeholder="". And the component EMITS an event Emitter. That will need to add (emitGuess)="" to send a event with the value typed by user. Example:

<app-input 
  placeholder="new placeholder"
  isReadonly= true
  (emitGuess)="myMethod($event)"
 >
 </app-input>
